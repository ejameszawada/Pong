# Pong
Pong made in Processing using Python

This was made for my midterm project in the Computational Media course at the University of Mississippi. The assignment was to use the lessons we were
taught previously in the course and make something creative. It required a little bit more than what we had learned at the time, but I thought it would
be fun to recreate Pong.
